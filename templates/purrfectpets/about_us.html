    <h5>We are a small group of Compsci students who have designed this site to allow pet owners to share pictures of their
	pets with others.
	Pet owners can create accounts in order to create posts, comment on other pets and rate them by pressing an “Aww” button – 
	there is no “downvote” or five-star scale, only a positive rating (this is done to decrease negativity and promote positivity).
